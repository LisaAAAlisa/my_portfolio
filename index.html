                        My name's Alisa Macedo and I'm a recent graduate of the Rice University Full Stack We Developer Bootcamp. <br><br>
                        Prior to joining the bootcamp, I was working as a legal assistant for a very large and very prominent law firm. It's been great but I wanted to learn to code for a while and even checking out some free online classes to get me started. So when the pandemic hit and I eventually got laid off, I decided to take this as an opportunity/a new door to do the one thing I've been wanting to do for the last few years, and so my new journey began. 
                        <br><br>
                        To be honest, for someone who comes from a non-tech background, it's been a challending path, but I found myself captivated by all the possibilities that web developing provides. It's amazing to see things show up on your screen just because someone wrote it into existence, and the possibilities are endless. I love the problem-solving and optimizing parts, I love being user-forward, thinking about design as well as functionality. I love how good I feel when things are working the way they should.
                        <br><br>
                        I'm really thrilled to become a part of a programmer comminity and I hope to fill this portfolio with amazing new projects soon. In the meantime, please check out my current works by clicking the Portfolio button on top.

                        Thanks for tuning in! :)
